Hii! My name is Gabriella i'm 14 years old girl from Kenya! I'm an SDG Champion, Championing SDG 9, 14, and 15. And I really Love Animals!

My Project is a website called Dronomi The webiste is designed to help Teens/Children with a passion for flying drones and would wish to become licensed drone pilots in future.

 I love robotics and have a passion for drones and would love to help other children with a simular passion whether just a hobby or to become a licensed drone pilot.

I made my Project with HTML, CSS, Java Script and lots of creativity and hard work!

I still had challenges with CSS but i have learned alot like how to put an image in the website. I also put in a lot of dedication and resiliance!
